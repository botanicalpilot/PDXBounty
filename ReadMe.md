## Goals
* With the use of data collected by the Portland Street Tree inventory I want make a map where users can see all plants that are currently blooming or have mature fruit set. 
* The plants that fit this criteria will de displayed on a map. If the user selects a plant additional information, such as scientific name, family, genus, functionality type, native status, and edibility will be displayed. 
* My hope is that an individual can take a deeper look at the flora of their neighborhood and gain a better understanding of the trees around them. 
* If plants are native, we can encourage residents to propagate these species from individuals that have proven themselves in the urban environment. 

## Additional Goals
* Allow users to sign up and make profiles
* Allow users to submit data change requests for instances when trees have been removed, killed, or any other change. 
* Allow users to search for plants by field or name


## Technology 
* MongoDB
* ExpressJS
* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* Python/Pandas(for data aggregation)
