* Today I worked on aggregating data. I am trying to use pandas to combine data from two csv files. One file has the raw data from the Tree Inventory Project and the other has all unique item items from the 'Scientific', column in the first csv, when when each genere or species blooms, sets fruit (fruitBegin), and when the fruit is ripe(fruitEnd)
* My issue now is adding data from the second csv file into the first. I did this before in other projects, but only in a boolean sense. Either the columns matched and one data item was added to the column or they didn't. 
* I think I am going to make a small test batch of data so I can begin getting my backend set up. I can solve this issue later or in another way if needed. 
* Setup new cluster on MongoDb Atlas for project
